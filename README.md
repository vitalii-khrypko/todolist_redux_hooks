# Todolist Redux Hooks

Todolist Redux Hooks is a React to-do list application that utilizes **global state management with Redux**. The project employs **React hooks (`useSelector` and `useDispatch`)** for state access and actions dispatching, instead of using `connect`. The reducer logic is manually implemented, following **Redux Core principles**.

## Technologies
- **React** - for building the user interface.
- **Redux (manual reducer implementation)** - for centralized state management.
- **React-Redux Hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`)** - for interacting with the Redux store.
- **CSS3** - for styling the application.

## Features
- Add, remove, and toggle tasks as completed.
- Global state management using Redux.
- Uses **React hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`)** instead of `connect()`.
- Manually written reducer logic and actions.
- Simple and clean UI.
